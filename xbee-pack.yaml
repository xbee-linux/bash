  The Bash package contains the Bourne-Again SHell.
  Installed programs: bash, bashbug, and sh (link to bash)
  Installed directory: /usr/include/bash, /usr/lib/bash, and /usr/share/doc/bash-5.1.8
  Short Descriptions
    bash: A widely-used command interpreter; it performs many types of expansions and substitutions on a given command line before executing it, thus making this interpreter a powerful tool
    bashbug: A shell script to help the user compose and mail standard formatted bug reports concerning bash
    sh: A symlink to the bash program; when invoked as sh, bash tries to mimic the startup behavior of historical versions of sh as closely as possible, while conforming to the POSIX standard as well
